This module implements a GUI for the Wacom Linux Drivers and extends it with
profile support to handle different button / pen layouts per profile.

For hardware support have a look at https://linuxwacom.github.io/

Configuration can be located in System Settings -> Input devices -> Tablets

Easy profile switching is supported via hotkeys or a small plasma applet in
tray notification area. In addition, a daemon running in the background helps
with hotplug support.
